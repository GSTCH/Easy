//* Example 03-DimmingLedWithSwitch
//*
//* Example of a combination of a switch with two positions  
//* and a variable output. The lamp lights depending of switch
//* on/off and the amount of the analog value.
//*
//* Hardware:
//* - Switch with two Position (On/Off) on Pin 14(Pulldown internal, no Resistor needed)
//* - LED with 220 Ohm on Pin 6 / Pin 13 is OnBoard LED --> no additional hardware
//* - Potentiometer 10kOhm at Pin A0
//*
//* Hardware:
//* - LED with 220 Ohm on Pin 6 / Pin 13 is OnBoard LED --> no additional hardware
//* - Potentiometer 10kOhm at Pin A0
//*
//* The pins are for the Arduino Mega 2560 test board, on which all 
//* tests and examples are possible. Adjust the pins depending on 
//* your board.
//*
//* In the directory with the example is also a picture of the breadboard.
