Sketch made easy for Arduino
****************************
This libary is an abstraction of an Arduino sketch on logic level. Instead of programming in bits and bytes, the control logic is configured by combining the classes. For this create objects of inputs, actions and combine them with relations and conditions. There are an amount of example to see how easy this library is to use. 
The library supports the remote control FlySky FS-i6X (up to 10 channels). The same functions are also available by an App (connected with bluetooth). The App has been developed with "MIT AppInventor".
